Building a complete .NET Core solution on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac

"This tutorial shows you how to create an application that accepts a search word and a string 
of text from the user, counts the number of times the search word appears in the string using 
a method in a class library, and returns the result to the user. The solution also includes unit 
testing for the class library as an introduction to test-driven development (TDD) concepts. If 
you prefer to proceed through the tutorial with a complete sample, download the sample solution."
